# Text2Food - A Textbot for Top Resturants in a City 
### Ari Chadda and Suraj Srivats 


### Why Text2Food 
This textbot pipeline using the `Google Cloud Places API` to locate the best restaurants in any city. This implementation harnesses `twilio` and `Flask` and is a proof of concept for a larger project that enables a full suite of text-based features designed to help local restaurants that have been affected by COVID-19. Our goal is for users to interact with local restaurants on a more detail-oriented level that gives both parties the ability to see metrics including a daily customer count, # users ordering in (vs. take out), custom messages from local business owners, etc.

The text-based medium allows for greater cross-platform generalizability without restrictions on data usage that may prevent users from using an app or the internet.
